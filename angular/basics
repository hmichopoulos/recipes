AngularJS == Client Side JSP

A Directive is a marker on an HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference some JavaScript code.
Also, Directives allows us to HTML that expresses the behaviour of our application.
"Expressiveness is the real power of writing Directives"

Directives can also be used to:
* define a custom tag or attribute which is expanded or replaced
* include Controller logic, if needed
* Express complex UI
* Call event and register event handlers
* Reuse common components

A Module is a piece of an AngularJS application. Modules can use Modules. Modules == application Components.

An Expression is way to insert dynamic values into our HTML.

Controllers are where we define our application's behaviour by defining functions and values.

Directives: ng-app, ng-controller, ng-show (if property not exists, is tread as false), ng-hide, ng-repeat, ng-src (for images), ng-click, ng-init, ng-class, ng-model, ng-submit, ng-include, ng-href, ng-if

Directives inherit parent's scope. Isolate scope by setting scope : {}

Expressions: numerical operations, string operations, 

Filters: currency, date, uppercase, lowercase, limitTo, orderBy

var app = angular.module('store', []);  
// store is Application Name, used in the ng-app directive and the [] is the dependencies
